  "text": "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Scientists have documented a 1.1°C increase in global average temperatures since pre-industrial times, with most of this warming occurring in the past 40 years. The effects are becoming increasingly visible: rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, and ecosystems worldwide are experiencing unprecedented stress.\n\nThe primary driver of recent climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, from human activities. Fossil fuel combustion for energy, transportation, and industry accounts for approximately 75% of global CO2 emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we need to reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThe transition to renewable energy sources offers a promising path forward. Solar and wind power costs have decreased by 89% and 70% respectively over the past decade, making them competitive with or cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions. Electric vehicles are becoming more affordable and practical, with major automakers committing to phase out internal combustion engines by 2035.\n\nHowever, technological solutions alone are insufficient. We need systemic changes in how we produce and consume energy, grow food, and organize our cities. Individual actions matter too: reducing meat consumption, using public transportation, and supporting climate-friendly policies can all contribute to meaningful change. The question is no longer whether we can address climate change, but whether we will act quickly enough to prevent its most catastrophic consequences."
